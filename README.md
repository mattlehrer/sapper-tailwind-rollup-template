# sapper-template

Based on the default [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) template, added [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) with the method described by [@inalbant(https://github.com/inalbant) on [Dev](https://dev.to/inalbant/a-simpler-way-to-add-tailwindcss-to-your-svelte-project-11ja). The base Sapper styles have also been converted to Tailwind.
